# Property-Ease
Finding housingâ€”whether PGs, hostels, or homes is stressful. Tenants face fake listings, hidden costs, and unsafe environments, while landlords struggle with unreliable tenants and poor visibility. Existing platforms act as classifieds, but they donâ€™t solve trust, transparency, or sustainability. Property Ease directly addresses this gap.

-> SOLUTION
We aim to bridge trust,transparency,and convenience in real estate by creating a digital platform for buyers,
sellers,and renters to connect,access verified properties,and complete transactions seamlessly.

->WORKFLOW

Our property website workflow begins with users searching and filtering properties, viewing detailed listings, and signing up to save favorites, chat with landlords, or book visits. Secure escrow payments and digital agreements ensure trust, followed by feedback and reviews after move-in. Property owners register, list verified properties, manage leads, and receive payments, while admins oversee verification, moderation, dispute resolution, and revenue through commissions and subscriptions. The system runs on a user-friendly frontend, a backend for listings, chat, and payments, a database for records, and an admin panel for control.
